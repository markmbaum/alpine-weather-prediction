# Alpine Weather Prediction

This is a short project testing machine learning models for a two-day forecast using weather data from the Austrian Alps, using TensorFlow.

For information about the data, see the [WegenerNet info page](https://wegenernet.org/portal/v7.1/2021/1). The project uses 14 years of data from 155 weather stations with observations every 5 minutes.

Initial processing code is in the [scripts](scripts) directory.

Everything else, including the models, is in the [notebook](alpine_weather_prediction.ipynb).
